                        first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used 
                        in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting 
                        language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

                 C# (pronounced C sharp) is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, 
                 lexically scoped, imperative and component-oriented programming disciplines.It was developed around 2000 by Microsoft
                  within its .NET initiative and later approved as a standard by Ecma (ECMA-334).
                C# was designed by Anders Hejlsberg.
